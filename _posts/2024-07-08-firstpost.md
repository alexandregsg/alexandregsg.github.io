# Probability Distributions in Data Science


## An introduction to some of the most commonly used Probability Distributions in Data Science with real-life examples.


### Introduction

Having a sound statistical background can be greatly beneficial in the daily life of a Data Scientist. Every time we start exploring a new dataset, we need to first do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in order to get a feeling of what are the main characteristics of certain features. If we are able to understand if it’s present any pattern in the data distribution, we can then tailor-made our Machine Learning models to best fit our case study. In this way, we will be able to get a better result in less time (reducing the optimisation steps). In fact, some Machine Learning models are designed to work best under some distribution assumptions. Therefore, knowing with which distributions we are working with, can help us to identify which models are best to use.
