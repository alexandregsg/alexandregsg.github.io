Welcome to My Data Science Journey!

Hi there! I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Nova IMS, and I'm based in the city of Lisbon. My journey into data science began during my first degree in Economics, where I discovered a passion for data and its transformative power in improving decision-making processes within companies. This realization made pursuing a master's in data science an obvious next step for me.

Through this blog, I aim to create a  repository of essential concepts that every aspiring data scientist should know. I'll also share and explain the projects I'm working on as I continue to develop my skills.

Join me on this exciting journey, and let's explore the world of data science together!
